## Project Organization & Structure System (LLM Workflow)

This document defines the comprehensive organizational framework for LLM-to-LLM writing projects, including content structure principles, labeling conventions, chapter/scene breakdowns, and responsibility assignments. 

**IMPORTANT FOR LLM WORKFLOW**: All references to "folders," "files," "daily work," "timelines," and "file management" should be interpreted as conceptual organization, content labeling, conversation flow, and context management within LLM conversation cycles. Physical file systems, calendar time, and external storage do not apply to LLM-to-LLM collaboration.

---

## LLM ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT

### Conceptual vs. Physical Organization
In LLM-to-LLM workflow, "organization" refers to:

**Content Structure Principles**:
- Logical grouping of related content and information
- Consistent labeling and identification systems within conversation
- Clear hierarchical relationships between project components
- Systematic approach to content development and review

**Conversation Context Management**:
- Structured presentation of content within conversation turns
- Clear identification of content type, purpose, and relationship to project
- Consistent formatting and labeling for easy reference
- Efficient context usage and information organization

**Workflow Organization**:
- Systematic progression through project phases
- Clear handoffs and communication protocols between Editor and Writer
- Structured feedback and revision processes
- Logical sequencing of tasks and deliverables

## CHAPTER ORGANIZATION SYSTEM

### Chapter Naming Convention
**Format**: `Chapter-[##]-[DESCRIPTIVE-TITLE]`
- `##`: Two-digit number (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- `DESCRIPTIVE-TITLE`: Brief, keyword-rich chapter description
- **Examples**: 
  - `Chapter-01-Introduction-Overview`
  - `Chapter-05-Market-Analysis-Framework`
  - `Chapter-12-Implementation-Strategies`

### Scene Breakdown Structure
Each chapter contains modular scenes for maximum flexibility:

#### Scene Types and Organization
1. **Opening Scene**: Sets chapter context and objectives
2. **Development Scenes**: Core content delivery (2-5 scenes typical)
3. **Supporting Scenes**: Examples, case studies, elaboration
4. **Transition Scene**: Connects to next chapter

#### Scene Naming Convention
**Format**: `Scene-[##]-[PURPOSE]-[BRIEF-DESCRIPTION]`
- **Examples**:
  - `Scene-01-Opening-Chapter-Introduction`
  - `Scene-02-Core-Primary-Concept-Explanation`
  - `Scene-03-Example-Case-Study-Analysis`
  - `Scene-04-Supporting-Expert-Interview`
  - `Scene-05-Transition-Next-Chapter-Bridge`

### Chapter Content Requirements
Each chapter must include:
- **Target Word Count**: Specified in Config.txt
- **Key Learning Objectives**: 3-5 specific goals
- **Required Research Elements**: Minimum source requirements
- **Cross-Reference Points**: Connections to other chapters
- **Quality Checkpoints**: Self-assessment and editor review points

---

## FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS

### Universal Naming Rules
1. **No Spaces**: Use hyphens (-) instead of spaces
2. **Date Format**: YYYY-MM-DD for chronological files
3. **Version Numbers**: v01, v02, etc. for version control
4. **Status Indicators**: DRAFT, REVIEW, FINAL, APPROVED
5. **Case Sensitivity**: Use consistent capitalization

### Specific File Types
