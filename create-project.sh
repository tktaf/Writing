Creative writing project created on $(date)

## Project Structure

This project follows the systematic creative writing workflow defined in the system files located in \`00-SYSTEM/\`.

### Getting Started

1. **Review System Files**: Start by reading the files in \`00-SYSTEM/\` to understand the workflow
2. **Complete Project Setup**: Fill out \`01-PROJECT-SETUP/Concept.txt\` and \`01-PROJECT-SETUP/Config.txt\`
3. **Plan Your Story**: Use \`02-PLANNING/\` to develop your story outline and structure
4. **Begin Writing**: Follow the systematic approach outlined in the system files

### Key Files

- **Manager.md**: Editorial role and responsibilities (at project root)
- **Worker.md**: Writer role and responsibilities (at project root)
- **00-SYSTEM/Scoring.md**: Quality evaluation system (95+ required)
- **00-SYSTEM/Organization.md**: Project organization guidelines
- **00-SYSTEM/ImplementationChecklistInstructions.md**: Template for creating scene-specific task lists
- **00-SYSTEM/Prompt.txt**: LLM prompt for expanding story ideas into complete Concept.txt and Config.txt

### Project Configuration

- **01-PROJECT-SETUP/Seed.txt**: Initial creative inspiration and story seed
- **01-PROJECT-SETUP/Concept.txt**: Story vision and creative direction
- **01-PROJECT-SETUP/Config.txt**: Story requirements and specifications

## Workflow

This project uses an LLM-to-LLM workflow where:
1. Editor provides strategic guidance and task assignments
2. Writer completes systematic scene/chapter development
3. Both Editor and Writer must score work 95+ using Scoring.md
4. Memory bank integration maintains story continuity
5. Systematic quality control ensures creative excellence

cat > "$PROJECT_DIR/QUICK-START.md" << EOF
# Quick Start Guide - $PROJECT_NAME

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Define Your Story (Editor Role)
- [ ] Start: Capture initial inspiration in \`01-PROJECT-SETUP/Seed.txt\`
- [ ] Option A: Use \`00-SYSTEM/Prompt.txt\` to expand Seed.txt into complete Concept.txt and Config.txt
- [ ] Option B: Manually develop \`01-PROJECT-SETUP/Concept.txt\` and \`Config.txt\` from your Seed.txt
- [ ] Review \`00-SYSTEM/Organization.md\` for project structure

### 2. Plan Your Story (Editor Role)  
- [ ] Create master story outline in \`02-PLANNING/Master-Outline/\`
- [ ] Develop chapter outlines in \`02-PLANNING/Chapter-Outlines/\`
- [ ] Plan research needs in \`02-PLANNING/Research-Strategy/\`

### 3. Begin Writing (Worker Role)
- [ ] Review \`Worker.md\` for responsibilities
- [ ] Use \`00-SYSTEM/ImplementationChecklistInstructions.md\` as guide
- [ ] Start with Chapter 1, Scene 1 following systematic checklist

### 4. Quality Control (Both Roles)
- [ ] Use \`00-SYSTEM/Scoring.md\` for all evaluations
- [ ] Both Manager and Worker must score 95+ before proceeding
- [ ] Document all work in appropriate folders

## Important Reminders

- This is an LLM-to-LLM workflow optimized for conversation-based collaboration
- Quality standards are non-negotiable (95+ scoring requirement)
- Systematic documentation ensures story continuity
- Every scene requires complete Implementation checklist completion
