## PURPOSE & PHILOSOPHY

### Systematic Completion
Every Implementation.md file created using this template must ensure:
- **Zero Omissions**: Every creative, technical, and administrative task is specified
- **Quality Assurance**: Multiple verification points prevent errors from propagating
- **Context Continuity**: Each scene builds properly on previous work
- **MANDATORY Memory Bank Integration**: Story knowledge is systematically captured and updated using mcp__memoryBank tools
- **MANDATORY Research Integration**: Internet research via mcp__duckduckgo required for factual accuracy
- **Creative Excellence**: Both artistic vision and technical execution are maintained

### Implementation File Structure
Each Implementation.md should follow this exact structure to ensure nothing is missed.
