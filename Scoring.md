# Scoring.md

## Literary Work Evaluation System (LLM Workflow)

**Total Score Range: 0-100 | Passing Score: 95+**

This comprehensive scoring system evaluates completed chapters or sections before submission to the Editor. Both Writer and Editor LLMs must independently score 95+ for work to be approved and proceed to next tasks.

### LLM Evaluation Context
This scoring system is designed for LLM-to-LLM evaluation where:
- Assessment happens within conversation turns, not over calendar time
- Both Writer and Editor can provide immediate, comprehensive evaluations
- Revision cycles occur through conversation flow rather than scheduled reviews
- Quality standards remain consistent while adapting to LLM workflow patterns

### Step 3: Feedback Integration
When revisions are needed:
1. **Prioritize deficiencies** by point impact

4. **Accept Editor's final decision** and proceed accordingly

### Success Metrics:
- **95%+ pass rate** on first submission after initial calibration
- **Consistent scoring** between Writer and Editor (within 3 points)
- **Continuous improvement** in average scores across iterations
- **Reduced revision cycles** as quality increases
